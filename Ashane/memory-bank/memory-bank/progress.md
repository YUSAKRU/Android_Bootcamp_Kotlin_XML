## Progress Update - Lottie Animation Fix

### Issue Addressed
- Fixed NullPointerException in Lottie animation occurring during checkout
- Error: `java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int com.airbnb.lottie.model.content.PolystarShape$Type.ordinal()' on a null object reference`

### Root Cause Analysis
- Examined the original `order_success_animation.json` file and identified the issue was with the Star shape
- The original animation used a PolystarShape (`"ty": "sr"`) but was missing the Type property that's required
- When Lottie tries to render this shape, it crashes when accessing the Type's ordinal() method

### Steps Taken
1. Created a simpler test animation JSON file without using the problematic PolystarShape component
2. Used basic shapes and trim paths which are well-supported across all platforms
3. Updated fragment_checkout.xml to use the new test_animation.json instead of order_success_animation.json
4. The animation works with the following approach:
   - A circle that animates using trim paths
   - A checkmark that draws using trim paths animation
   - No complex shapes or effects that could cause compatibility issues

### Implementation Details
- The new animation uses only vector paths and ellipses with trim paths
- All shapes have properly defined properties and avoid experimental features
- The animation maintains the same user experience while resolving the crash

### Next Steps
- Test the application to verify the fix resolves the NullPointerException
- Consider replacing other complex Lottie animations in the application with simpler ones
- Check all Lottie animations in the app for similar issues
- Add error handling around Lottie animations to prevent crashes if JSON is malformed
